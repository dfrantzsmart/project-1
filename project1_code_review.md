# Project 1 Code Review


## Clean Code 

Clean Code. Follows PEP-8, uses descriptive object names, appropriate comments, general and reproducible objects, functions accomplish a clear task etc


- Excellent job of creating functions within python files. 
- Code is easy to follow and understand. 
- Be careful naming variables nan. Can become confusing with the missing value nan. 
- Be more descriptive about how you name variables. For example, you used new_df. Naming the dataframe something more descriptive will make it easier to read and understand your code own code when you revisit later.


## Good Documentation

 Markdown explains work and defines sections, visualizations are easy to read and they relate to content, thought process is clear, etc.

- Markdown file is clear and concise
- Within in your ReadME, provide links to your data sources. 
- Specify the goals and conclusions (suggestions to the WomenTechWomenYes Team)


## Proper Data Science

Models are correctly specified (e.g., no heteroskedasticity in interpreting a linear model), valid conclusions drawn from visualizations, etc

- Project 1 is focused on data exploration, cleaning, and visualization. Therefore, we are this section will be assessed on those topics.

- Visualizations could use titles to help the reader easily read what information is being presented
- Consistent scales for y-axis, one graph is presented in scientific notation. Rotate the y-axis lable so it is easier to read.
- Traffic of 10 Busiest Stations by Day of Week lines are hard to read due to the color palette of lines being very similar
